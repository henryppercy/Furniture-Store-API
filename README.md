This application is designed to work with a locally hosted Database. 
To run this database: 
1. Clone this repo to your machine
2. Create a new database in your MySQL Database GUI called `furniture`
3. In Terminal navigate to the repo and run the command `php docs/json_to_DB.php`
4. You should now have 2 new Tables in this database called `categories` and `products`
